#A permutation of integers 1,2,â€¦,n is called beautiful if there are no adjacent elements whose difference is 1. Given n, construct a beautiful permutation if such a permutation exists.

n = int(input())

if n == 1:
    print("1")

if n == 2 or n == 3:
    print("NO SOLUTION")
    exit()

answer = []

for i in range(2,n+1,2):
    answer.append(i)
for i in range(1,n+1,2):
    answer.append(i)

for num in answer:
    print(num, end=" ")
